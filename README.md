- 👋 Hi, I’m @VictoriaJPirillo I'm a big dog lover (goldens steal my heart), all about the beach life and nerdy things like numbers and Excel spreadsheets ;0)P
- 👀 My interests ... too many to list, but to name a few photography, cooking, building things both by hand and virtually. One of my newest passions is to explore and photograph bridges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python & SQL getting better and better one step at a time. 
- 💞️ Would love to collaborate ... all things data science. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... LinkedIn is a great start.
